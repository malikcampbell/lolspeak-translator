# lolspeak-translator

Lolspeak! the language of the Lolcats. 

This is a simple python script that was intended to use a dictionary from the web to translate a text file provided by the user. It takes in a ' .txt ' file, and will translate
the contents into some pretty funny words. 

How to use:
1. Run the script
2. Type the path to the file you want to translate 
3. File will be saved to the current working directory
4. Laugh!
